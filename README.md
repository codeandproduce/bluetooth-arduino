# bluetooth-arduino
In this project I wrote an Android app that controlled a structure ran by Arduino through bluetooth signals. This repository is of my bluetooth android app.

The following is a video of a demo of the bluetooth technology: https://vimeo.com/223643800

That was not the completed project, of course. That was just when we first established bluetooth connection. The project went on to project lights from different locations to cast different shadows for our shadow art. What seemingly looks like a pile of junk, with light shone from the right direction, casts a shadow of a hand. This hand represents humanity in relation to our driving question.
